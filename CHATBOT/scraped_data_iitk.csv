ics_faq,ics_faq_block_1,Counselling is not the same as giving advice. It is quite different from the general opinion held by people. Going for a counselling session in no way indicates that you are helpless or incapable of solving your problems. By talking about your problems or concerns with a counsellor you will deepen your understanding of your problem and develop the means to deal with them. We are happy to talk over any of your problems and with your agreement may refer you to other sources who might be able to help better such as psychiatrists or doctors.
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_2,All registered undergraduate and postgraduate students can avail the service free of cost. The expenditure involved if you wish to see the psychiatrist is also borne by the service.
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_3,"You can contact the team members by seeing us in person, making a telephone call or mail-anything you are comfortable with. Click here to see the list of contacts."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_4,"It doesn't really matter how you present your problem.You can say whatever you like. Sometimes there is silence, sometimes you might find yourself saying things you had not expected to say. The counsellor will help you explore the matter and will keep referring to you to clarify his/her understanding."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_5,"You can come to us for academic problems, emotional issues, career awareness and financial difficulties. These may include stress related problems, exam anxiety, personal problems and career related queries."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_6,"Many of our problems arise just because we are human.We all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. No. Counselling is based in the belief that most people naturally strive to make the best use of themselves. When something goes wrong, it is usually because we are pushing ourselves too hard; because we are in a muddle for reasons we don't fully understand or because we are actually are suffering some form of mental distress which is distorting our view of reality. Therefore judging is not helpful or relevant; they need to be supported in finding their own way out of the problem."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_7,"We all make mistakes and have to learn from them, and it is normal to need several goes before we get something right. Needing help is a normal part of this process. You could only label it as failure if you had already decided you must succeed entirely on our own - which is not a burden you have to impose on yourself. If you think you've failed, the counsellor might help you see that this is not all there is to it."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_8,Paradoxically it can be seen as a matter of strength to ask for counselling. Many people think that they are being strong in not seeking help whereas in fact those who can admit to their difficulties could be considered the strong ones. Asking for counselling often mean you have taken the first difficult step on the road to resolving the problem.
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_9,Counsellors do accept that it is natural to want to appear successful and that most of us feel some shame when we have problems and so don't want to advertise our difficulties. This is one of the reasons we place a great emphasis on confidentiality.
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_10,Strict confidentiality is ensured in the Institute Counselling Service.

ics_faq,ics_faq_block_12,"No, but it seems to offer at least some help to the majority so is worth a try."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_13,"Counselling bears little relation to psychiatry except that both deal with emotional and mental processes. Psychiatrist are trained doctors, who work largely through diagnosis of illness and then by prescribing a treatment - usually involving medication. Counsellors are normally non-medical personnel who work by talking and encouraging you to find your own solutions. Counsellors can however recognize the symptoms of severe mental distress, and may suggest you to consider medical help if seems appropriate."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_14,"If you want to approach us regarding a friend, you are most welcome. We'll try our best to help you in helping your friend."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_15,"Remedial Classes are meant to clarify the basic concepts. It is possible that all intricacies and details as taught by the professor are not taught. However the underlying concepts are fully covered in a much simpler manner, on the basis of which further study can be done."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_16,"No, the remedial class are just a help provided when there is difficulty in grasping the concepts in college lectures. They may not cover the entire syllabus(only the difficult parts) and are sometimes not as regular as college lectures."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_17,"Anytime, when the mentor is free. It depends on mutual understanding between the mentor and student. The mentor can be contacted via phone or other means, and unless he is in the middle of something very important, he is willing to help out."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_18,"Not at all! It is always possible to miss out on certain concepts while in class or during self study and the academic load may make us all feel pressurized at times. Therefore, asking for help doesn't undermine your intelligence or your capabilities, but only demonstrates your willingness to learn."
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_19,Students of only UG and M.Sc. programs can apply for scholarships. Other programs are not eligible for scholarships.
ics_faq,ics_faq_block_20,Students who are unable to get financial support from the institute or from any other source.

ics_ug,ics_ug_block_2,"You might be confused about where to apply or which field would be a good option. Generally, you are not expected to have an in-depth knowledge of a topic before asking professors for a summer project. A motivation to learn and some interest is more than enough. It is a good idea to try out any field that fascinates you or maybe just sounds interesting."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_3,"Your college is your first point of contact to the research world. You could talk to the professors in your department who are working in the area of your interest. Webpages of all the departments have a streamwise list of the faculty along with their research interests. If you find the research work of some professor interesting, you should visit their homepage to find out more. It is a good idea to write a mail, expressing your wish to work under their guidance during summers and asking for a time to meet them in their office. Although visiting their office directly might also work, but some professors consider it inappropriate."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_4,Our college offers a limited number of research grants for summer projects at IITK through the SURGE programme. A notification is issued by the mid of even semester giving details regarding the same.You should keep an eye open for it.
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_5,"It is also possible to apply other colleges and universities in India and abroad in a similar manner. However you need to keep in mind that not every professor who is offering you a project might be able to support you financially. Do clarify this point in advance. A few funding programmes are open for 2nd year students, you could also apply to those. Indian Academy of Sciences also offers fellowships for research interns at universities within India. You can visit their website for more details http://www.ias.ac.in/"
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_6,"It is worth reemphasizing that no prior research experience or skills are required to ask for a project from any professor. Do not shy away from talking to them. Even if they are not able to offer you an internship, they might still give valuable advice and guidance."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_7,We bring to you the next tip for utilising your summers fruitfully. This one is focussed on grooming your personality and there are a plethora of ways of which we list a few.
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_8,Reading books : Why read books??They help in improving not only your vocabulary but also your cognitive skills. Books help you to experience things that you may not have faced in real life and thus they help you to expand your view of the world around. During the regular semester we do not get enough time to go through our course books (forget books of different genres :P). So summer is the best time. Some genres that could be explored:
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_9,"Self-help books: Eat That Frog - Brian Tracy, Who Moved my Cheese - Dr. Spencer Johnson, The Secret - Rhonda Byrne"
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_10,"Autobiographies/Biographies: Surely, You re Joking Mr. Feynman - Richard Feynman, My Inventions - Nikola Tesla, Wings of Fire - APJ Abdul Kalam, The Man who Knew Infinity - Robert Kanigel"

ics_ug,ics_ug_block_14,"Blog writing : Many of you are enthusiastic about expressing your views on politics, sports, education and what not! So blogging might be the way to go for you people. One important point that we would like to emphasise is that you should not be nervous or self-consous about your writing when you decide to take up blogging. Have faith in your views and your ability to express them. This is the only way one can learn to write."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_15,"It helps you to share your knowledge about any topic that you are passionate about. It may also aid you in finding more people who share your interest, and this is bound to widen your knowledge base. It also helps you to refine your writing skills if you pursue it regularly. This is because you will receive feedback from your readers and along with it some praise is also sure to come by as you improve with time."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_16,"Now, you might be wondering from where to start. Nowadays there are multiple online how to start a blog guides and online platforms such as Wordpress, Blogger, etc. So all you need to do is make your mind clear on whether you really want to pursue it. If the answer is yes then coming summer is the best time to nurture the blogger in you."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_17,"Gym/sports : Most of us think about getting on the treadmill once in a while. But due to our busy schedule from morning till evening during the regular semester, many of us do away with it. Hence, this is the chance for all those aspiring bodybuilders to get into proper shape. Joining a gym (and going regularly :P) will allow you to spend each day with a proper time table. Who knows, sweating at the gym for a month or two might lead to a physique that you had always desired! Apart from this, one should not forget the importance of playing outdoor games. Summer is a good time to indulge in your favourite sport. We are all aware why sports are important. But most of us do not have a habit of playing regularly and that is either due to lack of interest or due to lack of time or we re too tired after our daily routine to exert ourselves anymore than absolutely necessary.This is where we need to change ourselves. Just do away with your electronic gadgets and come out in the summer evenings with your friends and play any sport. We are sure you will not mind having a physically fit body along with those moments of arguments, joy, fun and team spirit!"
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_18,"English writing and speaking skills : There would be many of you who would love to have a fluent spoken English. As mentioned above, blogging can help you to improve your writing skills. Reading books, newspapers, articles and watching good TV shows/movies can help you build your vocabulary and structure your sentences better."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_19,"At the end we would like to mention that none of the ways mentioned above would have been unknown to you. Galileo once wrote,"
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_20,You cannot teach a person something he does not already know; you can only bring what he does know to his awareness.
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_21,Hence we aimed to bring these points to your awareness so that you give your personality grooming a thought as it always matters in every sphere of life.
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_22,"The next tip we bring you is about acquiring some a set of useful skills, which is yet another great way to spend your summers. They could range from technical skills such as coding to inter-personal skills such as strong communication and team-work. It s a great idea to start developing and sharpening these skills be it at the IITK campus or at home. Algorithmic and logical thinking has nowadays become a quintessential skill and is demanded of engineers and scientists. Programming is a good way to hone that skill. There are various tutorials that can be found online for almost all the major languages (Java, C, HTML, python, MATLAB etc.) and you can take up any one of these. We are providing some referral links for these such as"
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_23,"App and web development (using CSS/Java etc.) is certainly another area to look out for! Also, if you re interested in design, learning Photoshop or Dreamworks will be a good choice. You may also have interests in a lot of subjects that are not offered in the campus. There are courses that are offered online. You can take these up deciding upon your interests setting your own pace of learning. These online courses also come with an official recognition. A few popular sites for online courses are Coursera, edX and NPTEL."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_24,"Certain clubs and organisations (SAE/Aeromodelling Club/ Robotics Club/RuTag/GSoC) of IITK also offer interesting projects which help you to learn technical skills and let you dirty your hands on real life problems. You can contact the club coordinators for more information. You may also look out for courses and projects by departmental societies (such as ACA). These skills that you acquire in your summers will certainly be something that you may like to boast about in your resumes. And you never know, some of them might actually help you in your life in general!"
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_25,"What would be one of the most casual yet productive ways of spending your summer vacations? It would be learning something new while your stay at home, or even if you are staying at campus for that matter; typically something that has nothing to do with your career choices or long term goals but rather a skill that you always postponed to 'some day...'. These are activities that aren't too much of a burden for your brain and fit perfectly in the theme of holidays and relaxing."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_26,"It surely would be fruitful in its own unique way, when one day you play guitar for a handful of audience and surprise them with the skills hidden up your sleeve or when you make a new dish for your family. It doesn't only improve your personality considerably, but also makes for an excellent hobby."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_27,"You can learn anything that you feel like a musical instrument, cooking, gardening or a new language. These are skills that you start off by hit-and-trial (if your mom lets you do the trials in the kitchen that is!) With the aid of some tutorials, you will start to progress and would be quite good at the end of the holidays if you show a small amount of consistency. If you have tiniest of desire for learning performing arts, it would be a fantastic idea to go for many a summer programs offered by Gurukuls, across India. You may check out http://chinmayanaadabindu.org/ or http://www.swaminarayangurukul.org/ . With the serene environment of the Gurukul along with its sublime guru-shishya parampara, get ready for an ethereal and life lasting experience."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_28,"But even if you can not make it, do not get disheartened! Make internet your school. The tutorial for any musical instrument or cooking can be easily found on youtube. Some instrument specific links are available on Online College Courses ( http://www.onlinecollegecourses.com/2012/10/07/30-great-places-to-learn-a-new-instrument-online/ ). Also, Weekend Gardener ( http://www.weekendgardener.net/how-to.htm ) provides comprehensive how-to's of gardening. Some handy go-to places for learning a new language are BBC languages ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/index.shtml ), Duolingo ( https://www.duolingo.com/ ) or Babbel ( https://www.babbel.com/ ) - the latter two also have apps available."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_29,"You can also go for other new activities, for example, working in NGOs/ volunteering , such as Smile Foundation, Nanhi kali, Teach for India, Goonj, GiveIndia and HelpAge India. You will be amazed at the novelty of the experience from a volunteering work. The feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment is truly priceless when you see that your actions are helping others, making an impact in their lives and bringing smiles to their faces. Today, all of us are so goal-oriented that we ignore all the dimensions of life that seem to have nothing to do with our career paths.

You might find yourself unable to decide whether you wish to go for a research, or jobs in core or non-core sector . In such a case, you should explore as many of these avenues as possible An intern in a startup can be an interesting and exciting learning experience. Start-ups provide an opportunity to think out of the box and give you first hand practical experience of working in various operations of a firm. The work freedom that start-ups provide can be your chance to pitch and work on your own ideas. Startup Internship Program or SIP, an initiative by E-cell IITK, is oriented towards providing internships by start-ups for 2nd and 3rd year students.

ics_ug,ics_ug_block_43,"Summer break is a long period, so why not utilise it to bring yourself closer to your career goals? It is a good idea to spend your summers at IIT Kanpur and choose from a plethora of courses offered at the campus. The list of courses comes some time after the end of the pre-registration for the odd semester. Doing courses in summer has multiple advantages, to list a few: If you are interested in a topic/subject which you wish to pursue or just explore (Computational Fluid Dynamics/ Signal Processing/ Topology/ Linguistics etc.), then doing a related course is the best way to gauge your interest. Later, you could designate that course as an OE( Open Elective ). Summer courses are really useful when you can not do the same courses in the regular semesters due to clashes . Alternately, you may do a compulsory course in the summers in order to avoid a clash from the desired course which you want in the regular semesters. Also, if you've a hectic semester ahead, it will reduce the load ! If you have a backlog in some course and it is being offered in summers, there will not be a better opportunity to clear it. :)"

ics_ug,ics_ug_block_51,"For civil services examination , you can start exploring the syllabus and the reference books . For that, you may look up some sites where you can get some insight about where to begin and hear from the exam toppers. Some well known sites for IAS preparation are http://mrunal.org/ , http://www.insightsonindia.com/ , https://unacademy.in/ . Moreover, as reading newspapers regularly is one of the most important aspects of the preparation, inculcating this habit will be a good start."
ics_ug,ics_ug_block_52,"If you are aiming for CAT , then you could study vocabulary as it is the section which mainly bothers engineers. In second year summers, you can explore the syllabus and you may even start preparing from prep books which contain questions on analytical reasoning . You may even consider joining coaching classes during summers, which have a flexible timetable which suits your needs. These coaching classes focus on English, quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning and data interpretation. We hope you ll have a productive and creative summer ahead!"

However, there must be many more of you who would love to be in a wonderworld, maybe just for those 3 months, and obviously, why not?! Well, it is called a summer break for a reason! Ever thought of cutting yourself off from the wires around?? Relax a bit! Rest your brain - sleep, watch television, or just go around the town if that is what it takes to re-boost your energy before you start your next semester afresh. Enjoy the time off! Do you wonder about those family times which we all cherish but work always messes it all up? Now is the time. Going back home should be thought of as a vacation. Visit your grandparents. Talk to them. They surely would have a lot to offer. And then there are those trips you always wanted to do...maybe bungee jumping even! Plan a vacation . Doesn t need to be a five star resort; just a place with the people you love. Who knows spending some time at a monastery might change how you see life completely! And if you cannot travel to the exotic places to strike them off your bucket list, you could even explore your own city. Go to places you have always wished to but couldn t as the next day you would have some quiz or an assignment due or had to study for the upcoming exams! Surely, your city would have its own niches and unchartered territories. This time should be taken as one with no expectation . It is all right if you do not want to deal with the stress that the world gives you. Take a moment. Think. And then decide what is best for you to do this summer and how important and helpful it actually is to take up something just because Mr. Sharma s son is doing it too! So, this ends of our mail series, and we wish the best for you this summer. Get up and try something that you wanted to for a long time or just sit back and chill out! Be it an internship, a summer course, a sports camp, a blog you start, a language you learn or the much needed sleep you complete in this summer. Just enjoy whatever you take up! Cheers!!"

Since its inception, IITK has been an acclaimed institute for its wide-ranging sports facilities and because of the inculcation of the culture of participating in various sporting events for the students. The vast plethora of games and sports played on campus encompasses almost every outdoor and indoor game played across the globe."
vox_gns,vox_gns_block_3,"One of the important aspects of IITK that the freshers have missed out on in the online semester is the PE101 course. A subtle feature of the PE101 course was the Compulsory Physical Activity CPA. With trials for different sports in the first week, students join a sport and pursue the same for their first year. The advent of the CPA over the years at IITK saw a blooming sporting culture, with students joining sports as inexperienced freshers and graduating from the institute as one of the most accomplished sportspersons the campus has ever witnessed."

The old-school environment at the Old SAC takes you to the times which laid the foundation of the Games and Sports facilities at IITK. Even though the Old SAC has evolved several-fold over the years, the place gives you a first-hand experience of how seriously sports are taken at IITK. Home to the gym and the weightlifting room, the sanctum also hosts the Squash and Badminton courts. With the skating rink right next to the Old SAC, the sporting facilities at the center of the campus span numerous sporting activities and are bound to be the favourite place on campus for several students."

Here, we will try to explain the structure of the academic curriculum of IITK briefly (however complex it may have seemed :P). After that, we shall take a quick peek at the overall academic environment, and end by drawing a parallel between an offline lecture in L20 and a Zoom class. So without wasting any time let s dive into the third lecture of IITK101"
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_3,"The academic structure for every program is dictated by a departmental template. The template lists down the courses to be done in a semester-wise fashion, such that the minimum graduation requirements for the concerned degree are met. The template also considers the prerequisites of different courses, and the courses are scheduled accordingly. But the template is not binding on the students, and they have the freedom to schedule courses according to their own volition. Detailed guidelines regarding course templates can be found on the DoAA website.[1]"
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_4,Each UG program requires the students to complete minimum credits from different sets of courses. Different categories are listed and summarized below:
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_5,"1. Institute Core (IC) Courses : The IC courses are common and compulsory for all the UG students. These courses cover the fundamentals of various topics, ranging from basic sciences such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, to core engineering subjects such as manufacturing, electronics, and computing. The IC courses populate the 1st and 2nd-year template arrangements."
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_6,"2. Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) Courses : The minimum graduation requirements for UG students include a total of 5 courses (further classified into 2 Level-1 courses and 3 Level-2 courses) from a basket of courses from the discipline of Humanities and Social Sciences. A natural question that arises is Why HSS courses in a technology institute? . While engineering and science courses help us gain better insights into the world s technological and scientific aspects, HSS courses complement this learning by focusing on various social, cultural, and moral issues. Apart from developing one s critical thinking ability, these courses also broaden one s perspective of the world and life in general. Ultimately, these courses contribute towards sensitizing students and helping them become better human beings."
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_7,"3. Department Compulsory (DC) Courses : As the name indicates, these DC are mandatory for students belonging to a specific department. The courses aim to engulf the essential topics related to the department. Many DC courses also form prerequisites for other departmental courses."
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_8,"4. Department Elective (DE) Courses : Students have the option to choose from a wide array of courses from their parent discipline, which are offered as DE courses. DE courses are typically present from 5th-sem onwards in most departmental templates. The minimum credit requirement for DE courses varies across programs."
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_9,"5. Open Elective (OE) Courses : All UG students are required to complete around 54 credits, which translates to roughly 6 courses (for some departments, it is 63 credits/7 courses), as Open Electives. These are courses that students may take from any department/program in the Institute. OEs offer students an opportunity to explore diverse topics beyond their parent discipline. These courses are one of the significant aspects that provide the IITK Academic curriculum the flexibility it is renowned for."
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_10,"6. (Engineering) Science Options (ESOs/SOs) : ESO/SO courses are electives offered by different departments concerned with some specific but fundamental science/engineering topics. In total, the students have to complete around 40 credits of ESO/SO courses. Departmental templates have a few compulsory ESO/SOs, while the rest are electives."

One being the group of people around you, during quizzes, midsems, or endsems, representing the study environment which may tend to either bolster your preparation with their help and revision notes or may demotivate one s hard work and preparation by the feeling of competitiveness among the peer, so here the choice lies in your hands to judge whether this environment around you may be toxic or not. At campus, there is no dearth of study rooms, right from the most sought after the library, where you see students stamping their bags in the tables or chairs, during peak times (which generally includes end/mid sem, but one of the most influencing factors of their occupancy is generally the enthu of the incoming batch), there to safeguard their seats."

And the best part, where even the administration acknowledges the irregular routine of the students, is that CCD, library, student s lounge along with the Computer Centre present in the NCL labs are open round the clock(24*7) for the whole duration of the exams"
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_16,"The late-night chai or maggie or any other snack for that matter in DoAA s canteen, which has its doors open for campus residents even at 5 AM, gives a sense of lightness in the mind.

vox_acads,vox_acads_block_17,"The 1st-year IC courses lectures are held in L20, which is a massive hall with a seating capacity of about 600 students. But L20 is not just a lecture hall; it is a collection of diverse groups of individuals from across the batch. The typical antics of these varied groups characterize every lecture in L20. A crowd of Maggus populating the front rows, asking doubts enthusiastically during and after every lecture hour; a couple of late-comers trying to sneak into the lecture hall without catching the eye of the instructor; the occasional hooting and laughter when these dawdlers get caught in the act and invite a sarcastic remark from the instructor s end; a set of hungry souls continually checking the clock, waiting for the class to get over so that they can rush back to the hall canteen; a bunch of impatient fellows on the lookout for the attendance machine, waiting to mark their attendance and sneak away in the middle of the class; an enthusiastic clan of gamers occupying the last few rows, testing the best angles to conceal their mobile phones from the strict instructors; an avid reader seated in a distant corner of the lecture hall, deeply engrossed in a novel, cut off from the rest of the material world; and a horde of sleepy individuals, dozing off between lectures, trying to make up for the sleep they lost due to last night s bulla session."
vox_acads,vox_acads_block_18,"The crowd of Maggus is trying their level best to show enthusiasm (and gain some participation marks) by spamming the chat-box; the late-comers are stuck in the waiting room, pinging their peers to remind the instructor to let them in; the random conversations from the end of the poor chap who forgot to turn off his mic cracks everyone up at their desk; the occasional Zoom-bombing prompts the instructor to mute everyone; the set of hungry souls are busy having lunch during the classes; the multi-tasking gamers have minimized Zoom, and are busy playing the latest multiplayer game to viral, and the sleepy individuals have muted the meeting and have fallen into a deep slumber."

vox_anc,vox_anc_block_2,"Though the necessity of extracurricular activities is impossible to be undermined in college life, the biggest factor governing the career of an individual is the academic opportunities and professional endeavors one utilizes during this period. And the Academics and Career (AnC) Council makes sure students don t miss upon all these opportunities one can avail during their undergraduate and postgraduate years."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_3,"As the name suggests, AnC aims to foster all needs pertaining to academics and research for the student community. The council comprises various wings including UG/PG Academics Wing, Research Wing, International Relations Wing, and Career Development Wing which together thrive to fulfill all academics and research-related needs of the students."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_4,So how do these wings specialize individually and what do they have in store for Y20? Here it goes:
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_5,"UG/PG academics : It pertains to all academic matters, working on academic curriculum and catering to related doubts for both the UG and PG students. It holds academic and departmental orientations to acquaint students in the respective avenues. The wing works in tandem with SUGC/SPGC (Senate Under/Post-Graduate Committee) and DUGC/DPGC (Departmental Under/Post-Graduate Committee) nominees of the Senate to respective committees in order to ensure smooth working. Also, the wing keeps in touch with the DoAA (Dean of Academic Affairs) for academic purposes and reforms, sort issues and doubts."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_6,"For Y20 : Will provide info about the courses offered, how can they choose their courses later on, and learn from the feedback of seniors. Also, there would be department mentors who would act as a communication point of view to efficiently plan their template and judiciously approach their respective departments, and hold departmental orientations too."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_7,"Research wing : Interested in research activities and internships? This wing caters to all the research activities on campus, plus provides options of research through off-campus opportunities, internships and informs of all the possible scholarship opportunities."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_8,"Student Research Convention(SRC): SRC aims to foster student-based research and create a platform for young researchers to meet and exchange ideas. It organizes competitions, projects options, and helps students connect with professionals in the industry to get more insights on the field."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_9,"To generate the necessary intellectual and physical infrastructure for further research, the institute created the Dean of Research & Development position(DoRD). The Technopark in IITK serves as a vibrant research and innovation ecosystem for academicians, industrialists, and entrepreneurs to connect, collaborate and create highly advanced and innovative technology solutions addressing current and future challenges of the society. Further information can be found in the below website:"
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_10,"For Y20 : SRC will be open for their participation. Professors will take the session and spread awareness on relevant topics. There would be a UG Research handbook detailing them of all necessary and relevant information, including the availability of scholarship options."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_11,"International relations wing : Being the one-stop to stepping a foot overseas, The International Relations(IR) wing is a student organization dedicated to work in close association with the Dean, International Relations(DoIR) and the Office of International Relations(OIR), IIT Kanpur to improve collaborations of the Institute and its foreign counterparts. It also acts as a complementary link between the student community and the office."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_12,"It works in tandem with offices of international institutes and universities, manages foreign exchange programs, research and internship options abroad. Also, it covers the prospects of semester exchange programs with several reputed universities overseas, which can serve as a wonderful learning experience for students!"
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_13,Recently there was a language event from Japan and the IR wing was responsible for organizing it.
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_14,"The prospect of applying to an international graduate school is exciting as well as daunting. As the application procedure itself takes up considerable time and effort, and relevant preparation and the aftermath are equally important, the AnC initiated GRAD (Graduate Research Application Directory) which is a compilation of experiences and methodologies of the recent alumni who went through a similar journey and hurdles and ultimately overcame them in favor of their application. It can be accessed below:"
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_15,For Y20 : A handbook is being prepared which would guide them to the opportunities overseas.
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_16,"It would inform about PhD applications, higher studies opportunities, increasing MoUs, etc. For example, there s a body called IAESTE which facilitates international opportunities like internships and research abroad."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_17,"Career Development Wing : For the much-awaited season of interns and placements, students need to have a really good preparation to ensure a smooth pathway in the selection process. Enter the Career Development Wing, which guides the various career paths like options in core and non-core sectors. It conducts various workshops and sessions in acquainting them about the system, and also to improve soft skills during placements and internships. Here experts in industries are allotted as mentors, mock interviews are conducted to familiarize the students with the real scenario. Career Counselling is done to resolve dilemmas and to find an interest in a particular career path. To add more, there are specialized preparation manuals for different fields, for example of quant preparation, consultancy preparation, even for CAT preparation!"
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_18,"For Y20: Handbooks are being created where things to explore in their departments are included so that they can make a plan for their future. Newsletters, blogs, and handbooks are made available to help students in exploring different career options."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_19,"To recount the experiences of seniors and make it more relatable, there are several blogs on the original website, where seniors have shared important tips and tricks. And there are several individual blogs for various fields: starting from internship experience to placements fundae and even research abroad. There are several sessions organized for important events like branch change, choosing a particular OE/DE/ESO where students can clear their doubts from the council members who were in a similar situation before, and several more."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_20,"And to keep in touch with the latest trends and make sure students aren t lagging behind with their peers from other institutes, the AnC holds sessions for various important and beneficial courses like Machine Learning, introduction to Autodesk, approaches to file patents, etc."
vox_anc,vox_anc_block_21,"The AnC opens recruitment for the students from their 2nd year as secretaries, where they assist the managers of their respective wings in the works pertaining to the council. The General Secretary is responsible for overseeing the work of the council acting as an interface between the Institute policymakers and the students on all important matters."

vox_life,vox_life_block_2,Disclaimer: Summarizing Life at IITK is impossible. It is a different and unique experience for everyone. We wrote the following article as a light-hearted piece based on some of the experiences we have had and observed. Always remember that the possibilities are limitless.
vox_life,vox_life_block_3,"You set the alarm for 5:50 am. Guess why? The dreaded PE class was to strike again tomorrow, and you believed 10 minutes are sufficient to get ready. If you get late by even a minute, the PE grounds gates would be closed, and you would be marked absent. (75% attendance is compulsory)"
vox_life,vox_life_block_4,"However, at 5:30 am, you are woken up by an annoying buzzing alarm, ruining 20 precious minutes of your sleep. Nevertheless, you dutifully wake up your wingies for PE and rush to the ground."
vox_life,vox_life_block_5,"If it s your first PE class and your name starts with an A, there s a good chance you ll be seen at the main sports stadium. For all the athletics enthusiasts, it s a huge ground with a well-maintained grass track. Discus throw, pole vault, long jump, running, you ll get to try it all! Besides, there are nets as well as a pitch for cricket lovers."
vox_life,vox_life_block_6,"For the unique ones, whose names start with a Z or a Y , you ll have to walk or cycle to the hockey and football ground: a fascinating place for the risk-takers, since it is pretty easy to escape back to your hall after marking your attendance here (Not recommended at all!). Opposite the ground, you ll find the New SAC, where there are three indoor wooden badminton courts, well-maintained squash courts and a big wooden-floored TT room. The swimming coach will also accompany a few of you from the ground to the Olympic-size 8-lane swimming pool, where you can try a few strokes or even play water polo."
vox_life,vox_life_block_7,"If you find yourself marking attendance at the Old SAC, you ll be divided into the four courts and try your hand volleyball. Just adjacent to the volleyball courts, there are two walls for brushing up your tennis skills before you play in one of the six synthetic courts. At this location only, there is a fully equipped gym for the fitness freaks where you can have a go at weightlifting."
vox_life,vox_life_block_8,"Don t worry if you don t get to play your favourite sport in the first class; you ll get to try them all out. If you re too eager, you re welcome to visit any of the facilities during the open hours."
vox_life,vox_life_block_9,"Huff, all this running in the morning must be tiring. The feeling of coming back from PE, throwing your shoes, and crashing out on the bed is inexplicable. But wait, it s been two weeks, and you haven t done your laundry. You reluctantly get up and head to the shared washroom area with your clothes, and to your disappointment, find the only washing machine occupied. You can t bathe too, because all the bathrooms are in use. At this moment, if you re determined to complete the chores, you ll walk to some other wing and try your luck. But on the way, you might find yourself knocking on the door of your friend s room and spend an hour cribbing about laundry, life, academics and PE. It s likely that you will form long-lasting bonds with your wingies and often find 8-9 people hanging out in small rooms meant for two."
vox_life,vox_life_block_10,"It s time to get to the mess, have a quick breakfast and head for the classes. If you don t have time, you can always grab a few biscuits and rush! There are 20 lecture halls, out of which you have to find yours. Most of your lectures in the first year will be conducted in the L20, the biggest lecture hall of IITK with a capacity to accommodate more than 500 students. For the tutorials, you ll have to make your way to another lecture hall or go to the tutorial block in the short 10-minute gap between lectures. The skywalk in the academic area is a fast way to navigate through the complex. Getting lost in the maze-like lecture hall complex is inevitable, but beautiful in its own way! You may, accidentally, fall asleep during lectures but friends at your side will shove you into consciousness."
vox_life,vox_life_block_11,"To satisfy hunger between lectures, you could make your way to the SL canteen to grab a cup of coffee or tea, along with Maggi or a samosa. Next to it, there s CCD, an aromatic storehouse of caffeine that keeps you up during twilight hours to study for exams. (Search: Twilight CCD). During winter months, basking in the sun while sitting on the ground in front of L20 with friends is a common idea to pass time as well. The most important part, do not forget to lock your cycle; otherwise, there s a good chance the SIS guards would confiscate your cycle, and you ll be asked to find proof of ownership ."
vox_life,vox_life_block_12,"After your class, you ll need to rush directly to the mess if you want to avoid an extremely long queue. It is humanly impossible to have your lunch in 40 minutes and reach the lab on time (at 2 pm). So, as they say, desperate times call for desperate measures: you ll scan through the queue carefully and spot a wingie or a random person you met once in the orientation. Next step, do some small talk with the person and casually, insert yourself right before him in the queue. This strategy works most of the time when you need to expedite the process of getting lunch. If you are lucky enough, you might also get the Paneer in the Matter Paneer."
vox_life,vox_life_block_13,"The food by itself might not be so tasty, but it s decent and one can easily manage. A pinch of laughter and a handful of intellectual conversation with your batchmates over the mess table makes it taste even better. By the time you finish your lunch, it is already 1:50, and you have to rush to the labs."
vox_life,vox_life_block_14,"Most of the labs are in the New Core Lab Building (a.k.a NCL). The ESC101 labs are air-conditioned and comfortable. Most importantly, you can go to the lab in shorts and chappal . For those who solve the coding problems way too quickly, receiving many deadly stares from batchmates would be a common sighting. However, for the Physics labs and Chemistry labs, you need to wear shoes with full pants and lab glasses along with a lab coat, respectively. Remember to write the practicals before coming to the lab! The labs do have some cool stuff, like an electron beam and chemicals to make beautiful blue-coloured imprints. Most often, you ll get your readings wrong, but then what are friends for? ;)."
vox_life,vox_life_block_15,"The only lab not in the NCL is the TA101 lab. The lab is located in the most unfounded corners of the academic area. For this lab, you need to carry a drafter, cello tapes, erasers, pencils, among other instruments. Getting those marks for neatness, despite the numerous erased pencil marks, is the real challenge."
vox_life,vox_life_block_16,"The grind never ends. After long hours of labs and lectures, you ll now head to CPA/CCA (Compulsory Physical/Cultural Activities). If you have opted for sports, you ll go to the respective courts/grounds for intense practice sessions. Apart from mainstream sports, there are various other options one may opt from like Yoga, Taekwondo, wall-climbing, NCC, NSS, dance, arts or dramatics. New SAC has a spacious yoga and aerobics hall where you can workout. Just behind the new SAC building, there s a wall-climbing rock for all the adventure enthusiasts. At last, for those of you interested in self-defence, the main ground stadium is the place to be in the evenings."
vox_life,vox_life_block_17,"Generally, you could attend one of the many competitions/workshops/events/talks happening on the campus. However, on the days you have a club meeting, you ll head to the new SAC (Student Activity Centre)."
vox_life,vox_life_block_18,"Most of the cultural clubs have an allotted room here, in the new SAC (right beside the OAT), where they conduct their events, meetings and bulla-sessions. If you are in the Astronomy Club, you d be sitting in their beautiful student-made planetarium on the rooftop. If you are in the Student Senate or one of the many student-led committees, you ll be meeting in a modern carpeted conference room, which is designed to look like a mini-Parliament. The sheer diversity of people, ideas and events that we do, as the student community at IIT Kanpur is fascinating."
vox_life,vox_life_block_19,"From the freshers night to the dance and music competitions for Galaxy (inter-hall cultural competition) to movie or match screenings, the OAT (open-air theatre) plays a host for all the major campus events. Days, when OAT is jam-packed with the audience, is a sight to behold."
vox_life,vox_life_block_20,"Right behind the OAT is the Pronite ground, which hosts the biggest concerts during Antaragni and Techkriti. Also, behind the OAT is the oxidation pond, a quiet pond with lots of ducks and swans. Interestingly, these are the corners of the campus, much like the airstrip, which you don t get to visit on regular days."
vox_life,vox_life_block_21,"A meeting at the new SAC is generally followed by exciting conversations over a Kathi roll or a Dominoes pizza, for dinner."
vox_life,vox_life_block_22,"Done with the extracurriculars, now you ll need to study for the upcoming quiz. While some people prefer studying in their room, the constant noise and unending mischiefs may make your room unconducive to study. So let s explore some other options."
vox_life,vox_life_block_23,"Firstly, the PK Kelkar library: a three-floored (plus a basement), building, stocked with tall shelves of books, journals and archives. The library s wooden furniture and the comfortable central air-conditioning system reflects on the library as a confluence of the archaic and the modern . Subsumed in extreme silence, it is an abode for the maggus . The library generally closes at midnight but around the exams, it remains open for 24 hours. As a consequence, people sleeping between the shelves, with a blanket and a bedsheet, planning to directly go for the exam next morning is a common sight."
vox_life,vox_life_block_24,"However, on normal days, when the library closes at midnight, one can escape from the heat of the rooms by entering the air-conditioned RM building(Rajeev Motwani building). Although it is the official building for the CSE department, it is used across the branches for its comfortable couches."
vox_life,vox_life_block_25,"You may also choose to study at the Student Lounge. It has couches, comfortable office chairs, tables and AC. Finding a place in the lounge is a matter of sheer luck. On days when you need to use a computer, you d visit the Computer Centre. It has huge labs with rows of computers that you can freely use for studies. The computer centre also houses the supercomputer."
vox_life,vox_life_block_26,"This would be a good point to call it a day and return to your bed to fall sleep. However, it would be difficult to resist the urge to sit with your wingies in one room. You ll join the bulla and the conversation would flow from ranting about academics to confessions on everyone s crushes. It might even result in a heated discussion on national politics or diverse social issues as well. If that isn t for you, then playing Mafia, CoD or CS:GO is also always an alternative."
vox_life,vox_life_block_27,"After exhausting all the topics of discussion and debate, you ll feel hungry and rush to the canteen for late-night Maggi for it closes at 2. At last, you ll head to your bed and fall asleep, hopefully, satisfied with the growth, memories and studies you were able to extract from the day. If not, you will get another chance when you wake up. The upcoming four years are going to be diverse and life-changing, and we hope you re ready for both the highs and the lows."
vox_life,vox_life_block_28,"More than the infrastructure, the classes and the labs, it is your interaction with people around you and the random bulla sessions in the wing, canteens and clubs that have a significant role in making up your life on campus!"
vox_life,vox_life_block_29,"Vox Populi is the student media body of IIT Kanpur. We aim to be the voice of the campus community and act as a bridge between faculty, students, alumni, and other stakeholders of IIT Kanpur."

vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_2,"KIAP (Kanpur Indo-American Program) was instrumental in building the very foundation of IITK. The institute has taken a lot from the Mentor American universities, including their culture and student union system. The Students Gymkhana is a fully student-run organization that comprises various councils, cells, committees, and the Students Senate. The Gymkhana model aims to instill a sense of leadership, responsibility, and management in the student community by exposing them to real-life problems and key decision-making scenarios to make students better prepared for the future that awaits them."
vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_3,"The Gymkhana consists of the President s Office, the Students Senate, and the four councils, which are MnC, SnT, GnS, and AnC. You would ve probably met the heads of the councils, the General Secretaries, during your orientation. (That is if you attended it :P)."
vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_4,"At the apex of the Students Gymkhana sits the President, who is the representative of the students of IIT Kanpur at all forums of the institute.

vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_5,"The President is a member of various campus communities and works for the betterment of the student community. The Academic Senate (considered the highest policy-making body of the institute), Institute Affairs Committee, Anti-Ragging Committee among others are forums where the President actively participates to address and resolve the grievances of the students. The President is also invited to the Board of Governors meetings when matters relating to students are discussed."
vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_6,"It is also the duty of the president to coordinate and supervise all the cells, councils, and festivals to ensure smooth conduct of all activities throughout the academic year. Currently, the President is Mr. Nikunj Kothari, Y17."
vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_7,"Sounds like a lot of work and responsibility, right?"
vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_8,"To aid and complement the President in their duties, the President s Office was inaugurated in the academic year 2016-17 which comprised members at various levels to broaden the vision and reach of the President s scope of work. The Executive Council of the President s Office takes up a plethora of initiatives such as Convocation, Gymkhana Day, Yearbook, Senior Year Mentorship Program, etc. for the upliftment of the student community. The council coordinates with various Institute level committees such as the Animal Welfare cell, Environment Advisory Committee, Academics and Ethics cell, etc. to ensure a congenial environment for the holistic development of all."
vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_9,"Our own legislative body: the Students Senate, consists of members of the Senate, called the Senators, who are elected by their own batch. The Senate represents the collective voice of all the students. The heads of the various councils, which you would ve met during your orientation, are ex-officio members of the Senate."
vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_10,"Like all legislative bodies, the Students Senate keeps a check on all student activities, especially that of the Students Gymkhana, and is the central policy-making student body. In normal years, the election for the Students Senate and the executives are held during mid-January, and the charge is handed over in early March. Again, just like the Speaker of the US House of Representatives or the Indian Loksabha, we have the Chairperson of the Senate: they are the person responsible for running the Senate. Along with the President, he/she is ex-officio nominated in many of the institute committees, e.g. the Academic Senate. Currently, the Chairperson is Mr. Yash Maheshwari, Y17."
vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_11,"The Senate is a general forum for all students, has many sub-committees that have confined domains and are responsible for specific issues, like UG-SAC which deals mostly with the academic matters of the UGs, RPC, which constantly works on filling the loopholes and bettering the Gymkhana constitution, and CoSHA which is responsible for the supervising the functioning of the Halls of Residence."
vox_gymkhana,vox_gymkhana_block_12,"Other than that, the Senate has its own nominees to various institute committees like the SUGC, which is a committee comprising of various professors who create major policies for the UGs, like branch change; the SSAC (a word the whole campus fears) which deals with the disciplinary cases of the students; and the SSPC, which works in tandem with the DoSA for the disbursement of various scholarships and prizes."
